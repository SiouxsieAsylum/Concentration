# EPILEPSY WARNING!!! FLASHING LIGHTS AND COLORS!! PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IF YOU ARE PRONE TO SEIZURES!!!

V is a game where you have a word that represents a color. The word may be the same color as what it reads, e.g. "red" being the color red. Or, it could not, e.g. "red" could be the color blue. You have to left click if the word and color match, or right click if they don't, all within less than a second. But is it just that easy? The longer you go, the harder it gets. The background is usually white, but what if it changes to the correct word's color? What if it changes to the **wrong** color? What if the word is uʍop ǝpᴉsdn? What if the controls trevni? How long can you handle the dissonance?

## Unsolved Issues

I never managed to properly implement a "still playing?" screen after a certain period of time. It required a setInterval to countdown but the interval wouldn't clear no matter where I fired it. 

## Technologies Used
  * HTML
  * CSS, including flexbox and keyframes
  * Pure Madagascar Vanilla Javascript 
## Approach Taken
 This is a one page game with each stage fired with event listeners on the enter, left arrow, and right arrow. I wanted to just have quickly updating state on one page so there isn't too much to load. 

## User stories
This game is for anyone who wants a difficult game. 

## How-to-use instructions
Press Enter to start the game, press left arrow if the color of the word matches the word, press right if it does not match.
